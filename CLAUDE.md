# Off The Rails

Empty project — ready for the next train-ride adventure.

## Git Conventions
- One commit per phase/issue
- Issues labeled `enhancement` (NOT `shelly` — added via project board later)

## Shelly automation pipeline
Issues labeled `shelly` flow through the automated pipeline.
See `.github/workflows/shelly-label.yml` for project board sync.
